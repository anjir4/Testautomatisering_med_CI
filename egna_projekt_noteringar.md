Hur rapportera?

notes: does it make sense to automate this? why? why not? WHAT part in this makes sense to automate? what would/wouldn't make sense in general?
why selenium and python? what else could be used, and might even work better? motivate my choice

where does it make sense to test in this picture?
and if it makes sense to test a certain place, do you have the skills to do it?
can I learn to test this, does it make sense to ask for the time to learn?


It does not make sense to do tests that will fail with every refactor of code. Do not write tests on this level.
Don't reflect your internal code structure within your unit tests.
Do not test trivial code like setters/getters, do not test private methods. Test the public interface!
1. Set up the test data
2. Call your method under test
3. Assert that the expected results are returned
